## My thoughts on the assignment.

- The assignment covers the fundamentals of the frameworks and measures how much you know about the language/library. I used most of my knowledge in building the assignment like how hooks works, memoizing and using states (I used react). So Overall I think the assignment has a good balance on showing your abilities as a front end developer.
